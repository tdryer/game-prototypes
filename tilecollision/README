"tilecollision": prototype 2D side-scrolling block-breaker inspired by Terraria

Requires:
    Python ~2.7
    pygame ~1.9
    noise (easy_install noise)

Features:
    Tile-based collision detection that seems to work well.
    Map rendering with cached "chunks" to increase performance.
    Run and jump player controls.
    Simple noise-based terrain generation.
    Simple particle effect when breaking blocks.
    Lighting engine with brightness and opacity block attributes, and sunlight.

Run "python game.py", use the A and D keys to walk, W to jump, left
click to destory/place blocks, and mouse wheel to switch blocks in the HUD.

This is the first time I've gotten platformer physics working well. The key
insight seemed to be using a fixed timestep for physics and setting speed
limits. Provided that the timestep is small enough and the speed limits are 
low enough, the collision detection will work fine. Accepting these two 
limitations makes the code fairly simple.

TODO:
    add more particle effects
    more sophisticated map generation
    add some actual gameplay
